# ===Comments=== 

# Running with en_core_web_sm gives the message: "UserWarning: [W007]
# The model you're using has no word vectors loaded, so the result of
# the Doc.similarity method will be based on the tagger, parser and NER,
# which may not give useful similarity judgements. This may happen if you're
# using one of the small models, e.g. `en_core_web_sm`, which don't ship with
#  word vectors and only use context-sensitive tensors. You can always add
# your own word vectors, or use one of the larger models instead if available."

# The similarities are reduced for every comparison when using web_sm over web_md
